front_foot_braking_shock:
  title: "Front Foot Braking Shock"
  coach_explanation: >
    After front-foot contact, forward momentum slows down abruptly instead of
    being absorbed smoothly through the leg and trunk. This creates a braking
    effect where forces rise faster than the body can dissipate them, increasing
    load on the ankle, knee, and lower back.
  kid_explanation: >
    Try to land your front foot firmly and let your body move over it smoothly,
    instead of stopping suddenly.

knee_brace_failure:
  title: "Knee Brace Failure"
  coach_explanation: >
    After the front foot lands, the knee continues to bend rather than holding
    firm. This reduces energy transfer up the body and increases load on the knee
    joint, especially during repeated deliveries.
  kid_explanation: >
    At landing, try to stay tall and let your front leg act like a strong post.

trunk_rotation_snap:
  title: "Trunk Rotation Snap"
  coach_explanation: >
    The upper body rotates very rapidly over a short period of time, creating a
    sharp spike in rotational load. When this rotation is not well supported by
    the lower body, it can stress the side and lower back.
  kid_explanation: >
    Try to rotate smoothly through your delivery instead of spinning suddenly.

hip_shoulder_mismatch:
  title: "Hip–Shoulder Mismatch"
  coach_explanation: >
    The hips and shoulders are not rotating together during delivery. This
    separation can be useful for speed, but when it becomes excessive or poorly
    timed, it increases stress through the trunk and groin region.
  kid_explanation: >
    Focus on letting your hips and shoulders work together as you bowl.

lateral_trunk_lean:
  title: "Lateral Trunk Lean"
  coach_explanation: >
    The torso tilts sideways during delivery instead of staying balanced over the
    base of support. This shifts load unevenly across the spine and can increase
    stress on the side body.
  kid_explanation: >
    Try to keep your chest upright and balanced as you deliver the ball.

foot_line_deviation:
  title: "Foot Line Deviation"
  body_region: "groin_side_chain"

  description: >
    Assesses how far the front foot lands away from the delivery line at
    front-foot contact. Stepping away redirects ground reaction forces into
    the groin, hip stabilizers, and lateral trunk chain instead of transferring
    them cleanly up the kinetic chain.

  mechanisms:
    - "Increased adductor and groin load due to outward foot placement"
    - "Side-body (QL and oblique) compensation during delivery"
    - "Reduced efficiency of energy transfer through the pelvis"

  modes:
    OUTWARD_STEP:
      description: >
        Front foot lands significantly outside the line of delivery,
        increasing lateral load through the groin and side-body.

  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your front foot lands in a good position."
      moderate: "Your front foot lands a bit wide, which can add strain."
      high: "Your front foot lands too wide and puts stress on your body."

    coach:
      low: "Front-foot alignment is within acceptable limits."
      moderate: "Slight outward step detected, increasing lateral load."
      high: "Significant outward step causing elevated groin and side-body stress."

  cues:
    corrective:
      - "Land your front foot closer to the target line."
      - "Think of running straight through the crease."
      - "Let your hips carry momentum forward, not sideways."
