      low: "Front-foot braking within acceptable range."
      moderate: "Moderate braking impulse observed post-FFC."
      high: "Excessive braking impulse causing elevated lower-body load."

knee_brace_failure:
  title: "Knee Brace Failure"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your front leg supports your body well at landing."
      moderate: "Your front knee bends a bit more than ideal at landing."
      high: "Your front knee collapses at landing, increasing joint stress."
    coach:
      low: "Knee bracing effective."
      moderate: "Partial knee brace detected."
      high: "Failure to brace knee at FFC."

trunk_rotation_snap:
  title: "Trunk Rotation Snap"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your body rotation is smooth through delivery."
      moderate: "Your upper body rotates a bit sharply during delivery."
      high: "Sudden trunk rotation places high stress on the side and lower back."
    coach:
      low: "Trunk rotation smooth."
      moderate: "Moderate angular acceleration spike."
      high: "Sharp rotational snap detected."

hip_shoulder_mismatch:
  title: "Hip–Shoulder Mismatch"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your hips and shoulders work together well."
      moderate: "Your hips and shoulders separate slightly during delivery."
      high: "Large hip–shoulder separation increases trunk and groin load."
    coach:
      low: "Hip–shoulder sequencing balanced."
      moderate: "Moderate mismatch observed."
      high: "Excessive hip–shoulder separation."

lateral_trunk_lean:
  title: "Lateral Trunk Lean"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your body stays well balanced during delivery."
      moderate: "You lean slightly to the side while bowling."
      high: "Excessive side-lean increases stress on the spine."
    coach:
      low: "Trunk alignment stable."
      moderate: "Moderate lateral lean detected."
      high: "Significant lateral trunk lean."

foot_line_deviation:
  title: "Foot Line Deviation"
  body_region: "groin_side_chain"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your front foot lands in a good position."
      moderate: "Your front foot lands a bit wide, which can add strain."
      high: "Your front foot lands too wide and puts stress on your body."
    coach:
      low: "Front-foot alignment within acceptable limits."
      moderate: "Moderate outward step detected."
      high: "Significant outward foot placement increasing groin and side-body load."
  cues:
    corrective:
      - "Land your front foot closer to the target line."
      - "Think of running straight through the crease."
      - "Let your hips carry momentum forward, not sideways."
