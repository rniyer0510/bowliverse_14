front_foot_braking_shock:
  title: "Front Foot Braking Shock"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your front foot landing is controlled and within safe limits."
      moderate: "Your body slows down a bit suddenly at the front foot. Over time, this can increase stress if it keeps happening."
      high: "Abrupt braking at the front foot increases stress on the knee and back."
    coach:
      low: "Front-foot braking within acceptable range."
      moderate: "Moderate braking impulse observed post-FFC. Monitor load accumulation."
      high: "Excessive braking impulse causing elevated lower-body load."

knee_brace_failure:
  title: "Knee Brace Failure"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your front leg supports your body well at landing."
      moderate: "Your front knee bends more than ideal at landing. Repeated stress may add load over time."
      high: "Your front knee collapses at landing, increasing joint stress."
    coach:
      low: "Knee bracing effective."
      moderate: "Partial knee brace detected. Monitor repetition and fatigue."
      high: "Failure to brace knee at FFC."

trunk_rotation_snap:
  title: "Trunk Rotation Snap"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your body rotation is smooth through delivery."
      moderate: "Your upper body rotates a bit sharply. Repeating this can increase side and back strain."
      high: "Sudden trunk rotation places high stress on the side and lower back."
    coach:
      low: "Trunk rotation smooth."
      moderate: "Moderate angular acceleration spike. Monitor cumulative effect."
      high: "Sharp rotational snap detected."

hip_shoulder_mismatch:
  title: "Hip–Shoulder Mismatch"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your hips and shoulders work together well."
      moderate: "Your hips and shoulders separate more than usual. Over time this can increase trunk load."
      high: "Large hip–shoulder separation increases trunk and groin load."
    coach:
      low: "Hip–shoulder sequencing balanced."
      moderate: "Moderate mismatch observed. Watch for load transfer issues."
      high: "Excessive hip–shoulder separation."

lateral_trunk_lean:
  title: "Lateral Trunk Lean"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your body stays well balanced during delivery."
      moderate: "You lean slightly to the side while bowling. Repeating this can increase back strain."
      high: "Excessive side-lean increases stress on the spine."
    coach:
      low: "Trunk alignment stable."
      moderate: "Moderate lateral lean detected. Monitor over spells."
      high: "Significant lateral trunk lean."

foot_line_deviation:
  title: "Foot Line Deviation"
  body_region: "groin_side_chain"
  explanations:
    kid:
      low: "Your front foot lands in a good position."
      moderate: >
        Your front foot shows a moderate outward step at landing.
        Right now, the overall load remains low, but if this pattern
        is repeated over time it can increase strain through the groin,
        knee, and lower back.
      high: >
        Your front foot lands too wide, creating high strain through
        the groin and side of the body.
    coach:
      low: "Front-foot alignment within acceptable limits."
      moderate: >
        Moderate outward foot placement at FFC with currently low load
        impact. Repeated exposure may progressively increase demand on
        the groin, knee, and lateral trunk chain.
      high: >
        Significant outward foot placement causing elevated groin and
        side-chain loading.
  cues:
    corrective:
      - "Land your front foot closer to the target line."
      - "Think of running straight through the crease."
      - "Let your hips carry momentum forward, not sideways."
