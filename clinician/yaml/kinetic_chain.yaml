  states:
    smooth:
      label: "Smooth flow"
      kid_summary: >
        Your bowling action flows smoothly from start to finish.
        There are no sudden stops or rushed movements.
        Keep repeating this rhythm.
      coach_summary: >
        Continuous energy transfer with no visible breaks.
        Stable sequencing.
        Maintain rhythm and repeatability.

    controlled_low_linear:
      label: "Controlled flow"
      kid_summary: >
        Your bowling is controlled and steady.
        You rely on balance and accuracy more than speed.
        Keep focusing on rhythm and consistency.
      coach_summary: >
        Low linear velocity by design.
        Stable patterning with no compensatory breakdown.
        Style-consistent, monitor only.

    interrupted:
      label: "Interrupted flow"
      kid_summary: >
        Your body slows down suddenly before release.
        This makes bowling harder on your body.
        Try to keep moving forward through the delivery.
      coach_summary: >
        Forward flow interruption before release.
        Late compensation present.
        Cue continued momentum through FFC.

    fragmented:
      label: "Fragmented flow"
      kid_summary: >
        Your movement breaks in a few places.
        This makes bowling tiring and less smooth.
        Work on a simpler rhythm.
      coach_summary: >
        Multiple disruptions in sequencing.
        High compensation load.
        Simplify action and restore continuity.

    unknown:
      label: "Limited by video"
      kid_summary: >
        Some parts were hard to see in the video.
        This makes it hard to judge the action.
        Try recording again from a clearer angle.
      coach_summary: >
        Pose visibility limits interpretation.
        Retest with full body visible and stable framing.
